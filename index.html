      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">Verifiable
          Credentials Working Group</a> is to make expressing, exchanging, and verifying credentials easier and more
        secure on the web.</p>

      <p class="motivation">
        Readers that are new to this work should read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">latest
        Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>. 
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#introduction">Introduction</a> and
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology">Terminology</a> may be particularly helpful to W3C
        Members seeking to better understand some the terminology used in this charter e.g., Credentials vs. Verifiable
        Credentials and Presentations vs. Verifiable Presentations.

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Building on the experience gained through implementation, deployment and usage
          of Verifiable Credentials (VCs), this Working Group will extend Verifiable
          Credential foundations with new standardized technologies to improve the use of
          this technology on the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>scope</b> of the Verifiable Credentials Working Group is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Addressing errata, ambiguities, and interoperability problems found in previous versions of the Verifiable
            Credentials Data Model
          </li>
          <li>A data model for Verifiable Credentials, inclusive of:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Credentials and Verifiable Credentials</li>
            <li>Presentations and Verifiable Presentations</li>
            <li>requests for or submissions of Verifiable Credentials or Verifiable Presentations</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Registries for the data model to support extension points in the normative deliverables.</li>
          <li>Algorithms for the expression and verification of proofs that use existing cryptographic primitives</li>
          <li>Refining multilingual support in the data model</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is explicitly not a requirement that the new specifications be fully compatible with related past
          specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all the planned Recommendations have been published, the Working Group will continue in maintenance mode
          to handle errata. No new Recommendations are planned. <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20231103/#class-4">Class 4 changes</a> 
          for Recommendations published by the Working Group are <strong>out of scope</strong>, <em><strong>except</strong></em> if serious security
          issues come to the fore that require changes in a Recommendation.

                This specification is a general framework to associate proofs of integrity for Verifiable Credentials
                and concrete serializations for each of the defined syntaxes.
                The Working Group would welcome the usage of these techniques for data in general, but
                its scope will be to solve Verifiable Credentials use cases. The specific set of
                concrete serializations and cryptosuites appear as separate
                specification, all part of the same family of specifications.

        <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

        <p>
          In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, 
          each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least 
          two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.
        </p>

        <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

        <p>
          Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for
          implementers, Web authors, and end users.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite
          that tests every feature defined in the specification.
          Additionally, two or more implementations should demonstrate interoperability for each feature
          by passing these open test suites, and by showing that these implementations may interoperate with each other.
          For example Verifiable Credentials produced by implementations must be consumed by other implementations and
          behave as specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          A feature should be understood as a property or set of properties that are normatively required.

          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development
          of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
          encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification

          teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and
          issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit
          direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
          meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">Verifiable Credentials Working
            Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Verifiable Credentials Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular
          specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list
          <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-vc-wg@w3.org">public-vc-wg@w3.org</a>
          (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/">archive</a>) or on
          <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/verifiable-credentials">GitHub issues</a>
          (and specification-specific GitHub repositories and issue trackers). The public
          is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
          Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such
          a discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group will publish minutes for each teleconference on the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/">Group's home page</a>.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1 Consensus)</a>.
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
          consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or
          web-based survey), with a response period of 1 week, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
          consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
            Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the
          Process Document requires.
