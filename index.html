Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification will fulfill the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">
implementation experience required by the W3C Process</a> as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
The Working Group will seek evidence of independent interoperable uses from at
least two independent implementations for each feature defined in the
specification.
      </li>
      <li>
The group will there are sections in the specifications detailing any known
security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
      </li>
      <li>
The group will maintain and advance test suites enabling interoperability
testing for the specifications.

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Verifiable Credentials Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Verifiable Credentials Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list
<a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-vc-wg@w3.org">public-vc-wg@w3.org</a>
(<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/">archive</a>) or on
<a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/verifiable-credentials">GitHub issues</a>
(and specification-specific GitHub repositories and issue trackers). The public
is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
The group will publish minutes for each teleconference at
<a  href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/">https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/</a>.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of 1 week, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
